# Pong-Project
Windows Game Programming

Author: Jose Rivera

This project was given to me to teach me about Direct3D and how to work with it in
the windows console. It was also used to get us familiar with importing and playing audio.

The instructor gave us a template and I was tasked with creating a playable version of Pong
using Direct3D to handle graphics and sound.
